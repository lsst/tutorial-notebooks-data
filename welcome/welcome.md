# Welcome to the Rubin Science Platform Notebook Aspect

The [Rubin Science Platform](https://data.lsst.cloud/) Notebook Aspect provides you with access to Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) data products via a Jupyter notebook service hosted alongside the data. The available LSST environment is initialized with the distributed version of the LSST Science Pipelines, as well as numerous standard Python packages for astronomy, data manipulation, and visualization.

### How to open tutorial notebooks
In the menu bar of the Notebook Aspect (above) click on “Tutorials” to see a drop down menu of all the tutorials in the [tutorial-notebooks repository](https://github.com/lsst/tutorial-notebooks/). Select the desired tutorial (the first will always be an introductory-level tutorial). A writeable version will automatically open for execution, and will be saved into the folder /notebooks/tutorials/.
